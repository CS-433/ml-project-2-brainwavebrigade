### Project description
The goal of this machine learning project is to predict brain activity during movies watching using fMRI data.
### Dataset
The data where given by the MIP Lab (https://miplab.epfl.ch/) and are confidential. The data set is composed of 14 movies and their correspondinf fMRI acquisition of 1 participant. However one movie and the corresponding masked fMRI are available on this github through this link : . This allow you to run the model. We have also included the parameters of the best model (the model used to obtain the results of the report).

### dataset.py
Store the data, pre processing of the movies and masks for fMRI.
### Repo architecture

#### Run.ipynb 
Training of a model for one movie and its corresponding fMRI. 

#### model.py
It contains all the functions related to the model, its training, and its validationEncoder and model training functions. 
For each of the 14 films, 1 out of 5 TR was extracted uniformly to constitute the testset. Then, during training, the trainset is completely shuffled to prevent overfitting. We used a batch size of 1 at each iteration, meaning that the encoder was trained on 1 TR per step for 20 epochs, and we used a learning rate of $1 \cdot 10^{-4}$. In the following, we refer to this model as the "best model".



#### visualisation.py
Functions to visualize model performances, by plotting the E_loss and cosine similarity. Evaluate the correlation of each model.
